# User-Account-Program
User account program for college.

This is the initial Assessment coding challenge 1 at College

The prompt is as follows:

- Create a program that allows a user to create a username and password.

- Only accept the password if it is at least 8 characters long and has both upper and lower case letters.

- Force the user to enter their password twice so that the computer knows that the user has not made any mistakes when typing their new password.

- When an acceptable password has been inputted, write the username and password to an external file named ‘users’

- Create a function that uses an algorithm to suggest how strong the password is (Weak, Medium, Strong) depending on the length, use of special characters and numbers.
